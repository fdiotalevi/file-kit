;; ## Simple file manipulation in Clojure
;;
;; file-kit provides several functions to operate on files.
;; The documentation is available at http://fdiotalevi.github.io/file-kit/
;;
;; It wraps and reuses code from popular libraries like Apache Common IO and 
;; guava-libraries (everything under the terms of the Apache Softawre License) 
;; to create the best in breed file utility for Clojure.
;;
;; to start using it, add
;;
;; `[org.clojars.fdiotalevi/file-kit "0.2.0-SNAPSHOT"]`
;;
;; to the dependencies section of your `project.clj` file, and
;;
;; `(:use [file-kit.core])`
;;
;; in your clojure scripts
;;
